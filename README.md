# Instaclustr Operator
The Instaclustr Operator allows users to deploy, scale and manage any one of
data layer technologies deployed on the Instaclustr platform from Kubernetes.

## Description
The Instaclustr Operator provides all the same functionality as the Instaclustr API,
Instaclustr Console and Instaclustr terraform provider. 
- Removes the need to write custom code integration directly with the Instaclustr API
- Use of existing Instaclustr authentication methodologies
- Declare Instaclustr infrastructure up front
- Scale, modify and change Instaclustr infrastructure with
  existing Kubernetes management tools / workflows
- Simplify Kubernetes native development workflow patterns
  (CI/CD integrations, production deployments etc).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Create the .env file, copy all content from the .env.tmpl and fill variables. When the operator deploys, it will create the secret from these variable to access the Instaclustr API.

2. Deploy the cert-manager:

```sh
make cert-deploy
```
	
3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag
```

5. Install needed instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/<resource-group>/<resource-name.yaml>
```

**NOTE:** You can run `IMG=<some-registry>/operator:tag make` to simply install the controller 

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete all CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Undeploy cert-manager
Undeploy the cert manager:

```sh
make cert-undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Run the controller tests:

```sh
make tests
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
